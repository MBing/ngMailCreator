ngMailCreator
=============================

This will be a tool to create mails
that will show a preview of a mail you would
like to send out and an option to copy the created
HTML, which you can paste in your mail application.

Feel free to add issues and pull request to ensure this
will be a useful tool for most cases.

More info and instructions to install will follow soon!
